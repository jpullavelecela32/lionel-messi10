    <h1>How little Messi became the GOAT after World Cup</h1>
    <img src="lionel-messi.jpeg" alt="The captain of Agentina's National Soccer Team is walking on the field." />
<p>The captain of Argentina's National Soccer Team has a long list of achievements including:</p> 
<ul>
<li>1x World Cup</li>
<li>1x Copa America</li>
<li>4x UEFA Champions League</li>
<li>3x European Super Cup</li>
<li>3x Club World Cup</li>
<li>7x Ballon d'Or Winner</li>
</ul>
<p>Lionel Messi, who's been dubbed as the GOAT, has conquered all tournaments he has participated in after Argentina's victory over France at 2022 Qatar World Cup last December. This latest feat puts him in a priviledged list of players who've won absolutely all important titles. This list includes:
   </p>

   <ul>
    <li>Gerd MÃ¼ller</li>
    <li>Zinedine Zidane</li>
    <li>Franz Beckenbauer</li>
    <li>Rivaldo</li>
    <li>Ronaldinho</li>
   </ul>
<p> But <strong>"la pulga"</strong>is the only player who has won the Ballon d'Or seven times. The player who's behind Messi on that achievement is Cristiano Ronaldo with five.</p>
